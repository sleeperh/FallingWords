# FallingWords
 Falling Words from Brackeys' livestream tutorial
- Created Falling Words game using Brackeys livestream tutorial found here: https://youtu.be/HvMrOoUeqO0
- Modified such that it has an introductory and credits scene as well as the main game scene
- Intro scene has input field for entering player name and slider for manipulating word fall speed
- Modified main scene such that there is a scoring system, one point per word typed
- Modified main scene such that it displays player name and score
- Modified main scene so a word is destroyed after it reaches a certain point on the y axis and triggers game over 
- Credits scene includes a high score table made by Code Monkey found here: https://youtu.be/iAbaqGYdnyI
- Modified high score table such that it loads score from the previously played games and not fake scores
- High score table only displays 10 scores, no more. 
- Added clear button to clear off old scores
